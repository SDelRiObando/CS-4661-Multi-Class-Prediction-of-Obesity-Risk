We noticed that a smaller k value tends to make the model a bit more sensitive to *noise* , this can indicate it could be overfitting. Larger K values on the other hand means that it is less sensitive to *noise* but it can equally mean that its underfitting. From the results we can say that when k = 1 knn algorithm performace most accurate. On the other hand using a k value of 4 and 5 may be best since it gives a more stable option and it's accuracy isn't as impacted as other k values. \n",
